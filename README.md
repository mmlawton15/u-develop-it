# u-develop-it
My repository for a voting app. User Story is a team of developers are electing a new president and have started work on the front-end, but need help creating the back end. This was my first exposure to MySQL, and overall I enjoyed learning about this. I'm excited to implement it moving forward.

## What did I learn during this lesson?
- Made a database and tables from Node.js
- Performed CRUD Operations on a table using INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, AND DELETE
- Connected to a MySQL Database from Node.js
- Executed SQL queries from within Express.js Routes
- Tested GET, POST, PUT and DELETE using Insomnia
- Made changes to a database schema with DROP statements
- Combined relational data using JOIN statements
- Added constraints to remove references to deleted data
- Modularized API routes to help with code organization
- Implemented SQL timestamps to track when data is created
- Used ORDER BY clauses to sort data alphabetically and numerically

## What challenges did I come across during this lesson?
My main challenges were those that you run across when learning a new language. These include:
- Expecting one result but receiving another, due to not understanding explicitly what I was asking from the code. 
- Not being sure what verbiage to use to research my problems, as it's a new and unfamiliar language.
